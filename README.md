# 📱 MERN Setup Project

This project provides a basic setup for applications using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It serves as a starting point for building backend applications with these technologies.

## 💭 Features & Organization

- **Backend folder**: Contains the core logic of the server-side application, including routes, middleware, and configurations.
- **Config folder**: Stores configuration settings such as database connections, environment variables, and application settings.
- **Controllers folder**: Handles the request and response logic, processing incoming API requests and returning appropriate responses.
- **Models (MongoDB) folder**: Defines the structure of the MongoDB database collections using Mongoose schemas.
- **Routes folder**: Contains the API endpoints and connects them with the corresponding controllers.

## 👩🏻‍💻 Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment that allows running JavaScript code outside the browser.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used to develop both frontend and backend components of the application.
- **Express**: Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that simplifies API and server creation.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing application data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- **Postman**: API testing tool used to send HTTP requests and inspect responses during development.
